# Predict => Observe => Explain

## Understanding scope

This exercise is designed to check your understanding of **scope** in JavaScript.

Go through each of the examples in `exercise-0` and study the example. You need to predict what will happen when the code is executed. This means you'll need to work predict what the console output will be and if there will be any errors. Critically, you must also try and write down why you think the code will behave in this way. Try using your knowledge of scope to justify your answer?

Once you've predicted and explained, then run the code to check your answer.

ðŸ•¥ Don't spend more than 2-3 mins on each example.
