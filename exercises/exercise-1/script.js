/*

Exercise 1
----------

- Before running the code, discuss the expected order of each loop!
- Synchronous - Write code that loops through the array of greek gods and prints the
  index numbers and values to the console, e.g. '0. Aphrodite'
- Asynchronous - Same as before but the index and the value of the god at position
  2 in array should be printed after 2 seconds. Hint: use setTimeout()
