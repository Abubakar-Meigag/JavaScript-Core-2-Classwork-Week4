# Predict => Observe => Explain

ðŸ•¥ Don't spend more than 10 mins on this task.

Look at the example in `script.js`:

As with the previous exercise, you will need to observe, predict and explain.

Start by **observing** the code and getting a feel for what happens when it runs.
Then **predict** what will happen when the code runs.
**Explain** why you think it will behave in this way.

Once you've done the steps above, you can then execute the code to check your answer. Does this agree with your original answer?
You can also paste the code in `script.js` into http://latentflip.com/loupe/?code=!!!PGJ1dHRvbj5DbGljayBtZSE8L2J1dHRvbj4%3D to visualise what happens with the call stack.
